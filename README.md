<h2>Keywords:</h2>
<p>Markov Decision Processes (MDPs), Value Iteration, Policy Iteration, Q-learning.</p>

<h2>Packages:</h2>
<p>sklearn, tqdm, pymdptoolbox, gym, toh_gym, pandas, seaborn, numpy, matplotlib.</p>

<h2>Summary:</h2>
<p>This project aims to explore Markov Decision Processes applied for two different problems with different number of states (one with around four hundreds states and the other one has less than one hundred states). The analysis performed in this assignment is based on two planning algorithms Value/Policy Iterations and one chosen learning algorithm Q-learning. The experiments of the MDPs were done with Gym library and hiive MDP toolbox in Python.</p>

<h2>Others:</h2>
<p>> python 3.6</p>
<p>There will be 6 folders needed for graphs output: ALL, Genetic, MIMIC, RandHill, SimAnneal, NN</p>
<p>all comparisons need all algs models outputs.</p>
